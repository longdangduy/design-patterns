   + Builder ✨
   + Factories (Factory Method and Abstract Factory)✨
   + Prototype  
   + Singleton ✨


 - Structrural Design Patterns: are solutions to create a class structure,
using inheritance and composition to create a large object from small objects.
   + Adapter ✨
   + Bridge
   + Composite
   + Decorator
   + Facade
   + Flyweight 
   + Proxy


 - Behavioral Design Patterns: are solutions for the better interaction, communication between objects 
and how to provide lose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.
   + Chain of Responsibility
   + Command
   + Interpreter
   + Iterator
   + Mediator
   + Memento
   + Null Object
   + Observer ✨
   + State ✨
   + Strategy ✨
